# Simon Game

Welcome to my Simon game project! This repository houses a classic Simon game implementation, built with Node.js and MongoDB to provide a fun and interactive gaming experience. In this game, your memory and pattern recognition skills will be put to the test as you strive to remember and repeat increasingly complex color sequences.

## Gameplay

The Simon game follows a simple yet challenging pattern:

1. Launch the missile to start the game.
2. In each stage, a new color will be added to the sequence.
3. Your task is to repeat the entire color sequence from the beginning up to the current stage's color.
4. The game keeps getting more challenging as the sequence grows longer.
5. Keep playing and see how far you can go!
